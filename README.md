# BERT Chatbot Documentation

## Overview

The BERT-powered chatbot is an intelligent conversational agent that leverages Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) for natural language understanding. This chatbot can process user queries and provide context-aware responses by analyzing the semantic meaning of the input.

## Features

- **Contextual Understanding**: Uses BERT's deep learning capabilities to provide accurate responses.
- **Predefined Responses**: Matches user inputs with a predefined set of questions and answers.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built using Streamlit for an interactive and visually appealing experience.
- **Cosine Similarity Matching**: Employs cosine similarity to identify the best matching response.
- **Custom Background**: Enhanced with a personalized background image for an engaging user experience.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Ensure the following requirements are met:

- Python 3.9 or higher
- Required libraries installed using the command:
  ```bash
  pip install streamlit torch transformers scikit-learn
  ```

### Getting Started

1. Download or clone the project repository to your local system.
2. Place your background image in the specified folder if customizing.

## How It Works

### Workflow

1. **Background Setup**: Adds a custom background for the chatbot interface.
2. **BERT Integration**: Leverages a pre-trained BERT model from Hugging Face for understanding text input.
3. **Embedding Generation**: Converts both user queries and predefined questions into embeddings.
4. **Similarity Calculation**: Compares embeddings using cosine similarity to find the best match.
5. **Response Display**: Returns a predefined response or a fallback message if no match is found.

### Example Predefined Responses

- **Question**: "What is your name?"  
  **Answer**: "I am a chatbot powered by BERT!"

- **Question**: "What is BERT?"  
  **Answer**: "BERT stands for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. Itâ€™s a powerful NLP model."

## Running the Chatbot

1. **Launch the Application**:
   ```bash
   streamlit run chatbot.py
   ```
2. **Interact with the Chatbot**:
   Access the chatbot through the local URL provided by Streamlit.

## Customization

### Adding New Questions

To expand the chatbot's knowledge base, add entries to the predefined question-answer dictionary. For example:

- **Question**: "What is AI?"  
  **Answer**: "AI stands for Artificial Intelligence. It enables machines to simulate human-like intelligence."

### Adjusting the Similarity Threshold

Modify the similarity threshold to control how closely a user input must match a predefined question for a response. This can improve accuracy or allow broader interpretations.

### Updating the Interface

- **Change Background**: Replace the current image with your own design.
- **Personalize Styling**: Customize text colors or fonts to match your branding.

## Future Enhancements

- **Dynamic Question-Answering**: Incorporate real-time, context-sensitive querying using advanced NLP techniques.
- **Fine-Tuning**: Train the chatbot on domain-specific datasets for improved accuracy.
- **Multilingual Support**: Enable the chatbot to respond in multiple languages.
- **API Integration**: Connect with external services to enrich responses and provide more functionality.
